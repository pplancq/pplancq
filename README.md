# Hello, I'm Paul PLANCQ 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a full-stack web developer based in France with 7 years of professional experience. I've always been passionate about coding and have worked on private projects in my free time. Over the past year and a half, I've been focusing more on front-end projects using React. I'm passionate about sharing the knowledge and experience I've gained over the years.

One of my public projects is [dev-tools](https://github.com/pplancq/dev-tools), which helps to quickly start new React projects. I believe in clean code, and I consider code structure and readability to be of utmost importance.
